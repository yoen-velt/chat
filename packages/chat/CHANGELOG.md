# chat

## 4.30.0

### Minor Changes

- 5461ea9: Add native Telegram private chat draft streaming with fallback streaming elsewhere.

## 4.29.0

### Minor Changes

- ac8a207: Add `chat/ai` subpath as the home for AI utilities, including `createChatTools` for the Vercel AI SDK and `toAiMessages` for converting chat history into AI SDK prompts.

  `createChatTools` exposes Chat SDK operations as ready-to-use AI SDK tools so an agent can read messages, post replies, send DMs, react, edit, delete, and manage thread subscriptions across every adapter the supplied `Chat` instance has registered. Write operations require user approval by default and can be toggled globally or per-tool via `requireApproval`. Three presets (`reader`, `messenger`, `moderator`) scope the toolset, and tools can also be cherry-picked from the same subpath.

  `toAiMessages` (and the `AiMessage` / `AiMessagePart` / `ToAiMessagesOptions` types) now ship from `chat/ai` alongside the tools — keeping the optional `ai` and `zod` peer dependencies out of bundles that don't use them. The previous `chat` re-exports continue to work, but are marked `@deprecated` so editors surface a hint pointing at `chat/ai`; existing code keeps compiling, and migrating is a single import-path change.

- b75eedb: add burst concurrency strategy

### Patch Changes

- e60bc8c: chore: set supported Node versions in engines

## 4.28.1

### Patch Changes

- 0cc3d06: fix StreamEvent type from step-finish to finish-step

## 4.28.0

### Minor Changes

- eb5f94a: add message.subject for resolving parent issues and PRs from webhook messages, expose typed platform client via adapter.client
- c1cd9b5: Add `callbackUrl` to `Button` and `Modal`. When a button is clicked or a modal is submitted, the SDK POSTs the action payload to `callbackUrl` in addition to firing any registered `onAction` / `onModalSubmit` handler. This pairs naturally with webhook-based workflow engines for awaitable button/modal flows.

  Supported platforms: Slack, Teams, Google Chat, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Discord.

- 46d183b: Rename `messageHistory` → `threadHistory` (with backwards compatibility).

  The per-thread history cache was previously named `messageHistory`, which collides conceptually with the new cross-platform per-user Transcripts API. Renamed to `threadHistory` to make the distinction clear.

  **Renamed:**

  - `ChatConfig.messageHistory` → `ChatConfig.threadHistory`
  - `Adapter.persistMessageHistory` → `Adapter.persistThreadHistory`
  - `MessageHistoryCache` → `ThreadHistoryCache`
  - `MessageHistoryConfig` → `ThreadHistoryConfig`
  - File `message-history.ts` → `thread-history.ts`

  **Backwards compatibility:**

  - The old `ChatConfig.messageHistory` field is still read; `threadHistory` takes precedence when both are set.
  - The old `Adapter.persistMessageHistory` flag is still read; either flag being `true` enables persistence.
  - `MessageHistoryCache` and `MessageHistoryConfig` are re-exported as deprecated aliases of the new names.
  - The state-adapter storage key prefix (`msg-history:`) is **unchanged** — renaming it would silently orphan existing data.

  The `@chat-adapter/telegram` and `@chat-adapter/whatsapp` adapters now use `persistThreadHistory`. Custom adapters built against `persistMessageHistory` continue to work unchanged.

- 46d183b: Add Transcripts API for cross-platform per-user message persistence.

  `bot.transcripts` (when configured via `ChatConfig.transcripts` + `ChatConfig.identity`) provides `append` / `list` / `count` / `delete` keyed by a stable cross-platform user key. Backed by the existing `StateAdapter.appendToList` primitive, so every built-in state adapter (`memory`, `redis`, `ioredis`, `pg`) supports it with no changes.

  - `IdentityResolver` runs once per inbound message during dispatch; the result is cached on the `Message` instance as `message.userKey`.
  - Distinct from the existing per-thread `threadHistory` config (which backfills thread context for adapters that lack server-side history).
  - `delete` wipes every stored entry under a user key. Single-entry and time-range deletes are not part of this API — the underlying `appendToList` primitive can't support them safely under concurrent writes.

- 3490a8c: Add **`@chat-adapter/web`** — a new platform adapter that lets a chat-sdk bot serve a browser chat UI alongside Slack/Teams/Discord, without writing any client-side glue.

  The adapter speaks the [AI SDK UI message stream protocol](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-ui/stream-protocol), so [`@ai-sdk/react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ai-sdk/react)'s `useChat` and the [`ai-elements`](https://elements.ai-sdk.dev/) component library work out of the box. The same `bot.onDirectMessage(...)` handler fires for both web and other platforms — including stream-based replies via `thread.post(stream)`.

  Two subpath exports:

  - `@chat-adapter/web` — server-side `createWebAdapter({ userName, getUser })` that produces an `Adapter` for the `Chat` constructor.
  - `@chat-adapter/web/react` — thin client wrapper exposing `useChat()` preconfigured with `DefaultChatTransport`. Re-exports `UIMessage` and `UseChatHelpers` types.

  ```ts
  // server
  const bot = new Chat({
    userName: "mybot",
    adapters: {
      web: createWebAdapter({
        userName: "mybot",
        getUser: (req) => ({ id: getUserIdFromCookie(req) }),
      }),
    },
    state: createMemoryState(),
  });
  export const POST = bot.webhooks.web;
  ```

  ```tsx
  // client
  import { useChat } from "@chat-adapter/web/react";
  const { messages, sendMessage, status } = useChat();
  ```

  v1 covers text + markdown, native streaming, DM-style routing (`isDM: true`), persisted message history (`persistMessageHistory: true` by default — required for `channel.messages` since web has no platform history API), and abort propagation via `request.signal`. Out of scope for v1: cards/JSX rendering, reactions, modals, file uploads, edit/delete, and multi-tab proactive push.

### Patch Changes

- 9824d33: Security fixes for HIGH-severity findings:

  - **adapter-slack**: Replace timing-unsafe `!==` with `crypto.timingSafeEqual` when validating the `x-slack-socket-token` header on forwarded socket-mode events.
  - **adapter-github**: In multi-tenant App mode, eagerly auto-detect the bot user ID on the first installation client / first webhook so `isMe` checks work and self-reply loops are prevented. Falls back to `apps.getAuthenticated` + `users.getByUsername` when `users.getAuthenticated` is unavailable for installation tokens.
  - **adapter-linear**: Add optional `encryptionKey` config (or `LINEAR_ENCRYPTION_KEY` env var) that AES-256-GCM-encrypts `accessToken` and `refreshToken` at rest in the state store. Tolerates plaintext records for zero-downtime rollout.
  - **adapter-gchat**: Fail-closed by default — the constructor now throws `ValidationError` if neither `googleChatProjectNumber` nor `pubsubAudience` is configured. To accept unverified webhooks (development only), set the new `disableSignatureVerification: true` flag (or `GOOGLE_CHAT_DISABLE_SIGNATURE_VERIFICATION=true`). Mirrors the Slack adapter's signing-secret requirement.
  - **adapter-shared**: New `decodeKey` / `encryptToken` / `decryptToken` / `isEncryptedTokenData` utilities (AES-256-GCM, hex or base64 32-byte keys), shared by Slack and Linear.

## 4.27.0

### Minor Changes

- 1e7c551: restore attachment fetchData after queue/debounce serialization
- b0ab804: Bundle guide markdown and a templates manifest with the package so AI agents can discover Chat SDK resources without fetching at runtime. Guides are written to `resources/guides/*.md` and templates to `resources/templates.json` by the root-level `pnpm sync-resources` script.
- b9a1961: Switch Telegram adapter's outbound `parse_mode` from legacy `Markdown` to `MarkdownV2`, and replace the standard-markdown passthrough renderer with a proper AST → MarkdownV2 renderer. Standard markdown (`**bold**`) and legacy `Markdown` (`*bold*`) use different syntaxes and have no shared escape rules, so any message containing `.`, `!`, `(`, `)`, `-`, `_` in regular text — which is virtually every LLM-generated message — was being rejected with `can't parse entities`. The new renderer walks the mdast tree and emits MarkdownV2 with context-aware escaping (normal text vs. code blocks vs. link URLs), uniformly applies MarkdownV2 `parse_mode` to every format-converter output (including AST messages, which previously shipped without `parse_mode` and rendered asterisks literally), and escapes card fallback text.

  Also fix silent message truncation that the MarkdownV2 migration widened from a rare bug into a reliable 400. The previous truncator sliced messages at 4096/1024 chars and appended literal `...`, but in MarkdownV2 `.` is a reserved character that must be escaped, the slice can leave an orphan trailing `\`, and it can cut through a paired entity (`*bold*`, `` `code` ``) leaving it unclosed — all of which cause `can't parse entities`. The two truncate methods are unified into `truncateForTelegram(text, limit, parseMode)`, which appends an escaped `\.\.\.` for MarkdownV2 and walks back past unbalanced entity delimiters or orphan backslashes before appending. Plain-text messages keep literal `...`.

  Internal typing hardening: `renderMarkdownV2` is now typed exhaustively on mdast's `Nodes` union with a `never` assertion, so new mdast node types fail the build rather than silently falling through. Introduce `TelegramParseMode = "MarkdownV2" | "plain"` replacing the previous `string | undefined` at call sites, with `toBotApiParseMode` mapping to the Bot API wire format at the boundary. The `chat` package gains a re-export of mdast's `Nodes` union so adapters can build exhaustively typed renderers without importing mdast directly.

- a520797: Add `chat.getUser()` method and `UserInfo` type for cross-platform user lookups. Implement `getUser` on Slack, Discord, Google Chat, GitHub, Linear, and Telegram adapters.

- bca4792: Allow `task_update` streaming chunks to include optional `details` text for Slack task cards
- 37dbb4a: Add `thread.getParticipants()` to get unique human participants in a thread
- 608d5f0: Add `chat.thread(threadId)` method to create Thread handles outside of webhook contexts
- a179b29: Implement external_select block kit for Slack
- a8f2aab: Allow `plan.updateTask()` to target a specific task by ID via `{ id: taskId }` instead of always updating the last in_progress task

### Patch Changes

- 8a0c7b3: Fix Slack structured streaming when `thread.post(stream)` is called from a handler created by an interactive (`block_actions`) payload.
  The team ID is now resolved from `team.id` in addition to `team_id` / `team`.
- d630e6c: fix(chat): honor `concurrency.maxConcurrent` in the `concurrent` strategy. The cap was documented but never applied, so handlers dispatched unbounded. Also warns when `maxConcurrent` is paired with a non-`concurrent` strategy (previously ignored silently) and throws on `maxConcurrent < 1` to prevent a deadlock.
