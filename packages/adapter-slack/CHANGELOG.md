## 4.29.0

### Minor Changes

- 2f108bd: Rename the typed native client getter on the Slack, GitHub, and Linear adapters to match the underlying SDK class.

  - `bot.getAdapter("slack").client` is now `bot.getAdapter("slack").webClient` (returns `WebClient` from `@slack/web-api`).
  - `bot.getAdapter("github").client` is now `bot.getAdapter("github").octokit` (returns `Octokit`).
  - `bot.getAdapter("linear").client` is now `bot.getAdapter("linear").linearClient` (returns `LinearClient`).

  The previous `.client` getter is kept as a deprecated alias on all three adapters, so existing code continues to work without changes.

- c46fdb6: Add support for external `installationProvider` and Enterprise Grid org-wide installs.

  - New optional `installationProvider` config: `{ getInstallation(installationId, isEnterpriseInstall) => Promise<SlackInstallation | null> }`. When set, the adapter resolves bot tokens for incoming events, slash commands, and interactive payloads through the provider instead of the internal `StateAdapter` — useful for hosted token-management systems (e.g. Vercel Connect). The provider is read-only; OAuth callback writes (`setInstallation`, `handleOAuthCallback`) and the `getInstallation`/`deleteInstallation` public methods continue to use internal state, so callers using a provider should manage their own writes.
  - Enterprise Grid org-wide installs (`is_enterprise_install: true`) are now keyed on `enterprise_id` instead of `team_id` across event_callback, slash command, and interactive payload paths. Multi-workspace deployments using the internal `StateAdapter` for org-wide installs must repopulate installations under the `enterprise_id` key — previously, org-wide events would fall through to a `team_id` lookup that did not match what the OAuth flow had stored.

- fdebde7: feat(slack): expose direct `WebClient` access via `adapter.client`

  `bot.getAdapter("slack").client` now returns a typed `WebClient` from
  `@slack/web-api`, matching the existing pattern on the Linear and GitHub
  adapters. The returned client is bound to the bot token for the current
  request context (multi-workspace) or the configured default token
  (single-workspace). Use it for any Web API call not covered by the SDK's
  high-level methods, e.g. `adapter.client.pins.add(...)` or
  `adapter.client.usergroups.list(...)`.

  Resolution order:

  1. The token from the current `requestContext` — set during webhook
     handling, or by `adapter.withBotToken(token, fn)`.
  2. The default `botToken`, when configured as a static string or a
     synchronous resolver function.

  Throws `AuthenticationError` outside of any context in multi-workspace
  mode, or when `botToken` is configured as an async resolver function.
  For async tokens, await the token first and bind it explicitly with
  `adapter.withBotToken(token, () => adapter.client...)`.

  Also fixes `createSlackAdapter()` silently dropping the `apiUrl`
  config field.

- 2ffed48: Adapter internals are now `protected` rather than `private`, so consumers can subclass an adapter to override or extend its behavior (e.g. handling additional Telegram update types by overriding `processUpdate`).

### Patch Changes

- e60bc8c: chore: set supported Node versions in engines
- 06fb8e5: Align package shapes with the new `konsistent` conventions. All changes are
  backwards-compatible — previous type names are kept as deprecated aliases.

  - `@chat-adapter/gchat`, `@chat-adapter/slack`: moved `*AdapterConfig` (and
    related sub-types) into a `./types` module; the public re-exports from
    `index.ts` are unchanged.
  - `@chat-adapter/slack`: `createSlackAdapter` now accepts `SlackAdapterConfig`
    directly instead of `Partial<SlackAdapterConfig>`. Every field on the config
    was already optional, so no call sites need to change.
  - `@chat-adapter/messenger`: `MessengerAdapterConfig` fields are now optional
    (the factory still falls back to `FACEBOOK_*` env vars), and `logger` /
    `userName` live on `MessengerAdapterConfig` directly. The factory signature
    is now `createMessengerAdapter(config?: MessengerAdapterConfig)`.
  - `@chat-adapter/web`: renamed `WebAdapterOptions` to `WebAdapterConfig`; the
    old name is exported as a deprecated alias.
  - `@chat-adapter/whatsapp`: every field on `WhatsAppAdapterConfig` is optional
    (the factory still falls back to `WHATSAPP_*` env vars). `createWhatsAppAdapter`
    is now typed `(config?: WhatsAppAdapterConfig) => WhatsAppAdapter`.
  - `@chat-adapter/state-memory`: added an empty `MemoryStateAdapterOptions`
    type so the package matches every other state adapter; `createMemoryState`
    now accepts an optional argument of that type.
  - `@chat-adapter/state-ioredis`, `@chat-adapter/state-redis`,
    `@chat-adapter/state-pg`: the URL- and client-based option shapes were split
    into named interfaces (`*StateAdapterUrlOptions` /
    `*StateAdapterClientOptions`) and unified under `*StateAdapterOptions`. The
    factories now take the union type directly. Old names — `RedisStateClientOptions`,
    `CreateRedisStateOptions`, `PostgresStateClientOptions`,
    `CreatePostgresStateOptions`, `IoRedisStateClientOptions` — are kept as
    deprecated aliases.

- 0f0c203: fix(slack): prefer `webhookVerifier` over `signingSecret` and `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`

  When a `webhookVerifier` is configured, it now takes precedence over both the
  `signingSecret` config field and the `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` env var. Previously,
  a configured `signingSecret` (or env var) would shadow the verifier.

  - @chat-adapter/shared@4.28.1

## 4.28.0

### Minor Changes

- 3546b3f: use Slack's native `markdown_text` field for outgoing markdown messages

  Slack now natively renders markdown via the `markdown_text` parameter on
  `chat.postMessage`, `chat.postEphemeral`, `chat.update`, and
  `chat.scheduleMessage`. The adapter passes markdown through directly instead
  of converting to mrkdwn, so tables, headings, fenced code blocks, blockquotes,
  and other rich formatting now render natively in Slack.

  - Tables are rendered by Slack natively (no more ASCII-table fallback or
    Block Kit `table` block fabrication).
  - Plain `string` and `{ raw }` messages still go to the `text` field so
    literal `*` / `_` characters are preserved.
  - `markdown_text` has a 12,000 character limit (vs. ~40,000 for `text`).
  - The deprecated `SlackMarkdownConverter` alias has been removed; use
    `SlackFormatConverter` instead.
  - `renderFormatted(ast)` now returns standard markdown instead of mrkdwn.
  - Incoming `message` events are unchanged — they still arrive as mrkdwn
    and are parsed as before.

### Patch Changes

- 9824d33: Security fixes for HIGH-severity findings:

  - **adapter-slack**: Replace timing-unsafe `!==` with `crypto.timingSafeEqual` when validating the `x-slack-socket-token` header on forwarded socket-mode events.
  - **adapter-github**: In multi-tenant App mode, eagerly auto-detect the bot user ID on the first installation client / first webhook so `isMe` checks work and self-reply loops are prevented. Falls back to `apps.getAuthenticated` + `users.getByUsername` when `users.getAuthenticated` is unavailable for installation tokens.
  - **adapter-linear**: Add optional `encryptionKey` config (or `LINEAR_ENCRYPTION_KEY` env var) that AES-256-GCM-encrypts `accessToken` and `refreshToken` at rest in the state store. Tolerates plaintext records for zero-downtime rollout.
  - **adapter-gchat**: Fail-closed by default — the constructor now throws `ValidationError` if neither `googleChatProjectNumber` nor `pubsubAudience` is configured. To accept unverified webhooks (development only), set the new `disableSignatureVerification: true` flag (or `GOOGLE_CHAT_DISABLE_SIGNATURE_VERIFICATION=true`). Mirrors the Slack adapter's signing-secret requirement.
  - **adapter-shared**: New `decodeKey` / `encryptToken` / `decryptToken` / `isEncryptedTokenData` utilities (AES-256-GCM, hex or base64 32-byte keys), shared by Slack and Linear.

## 4.27.0

### Minor Changes

- 6b17c60: Add `apiUrl` config option for custom API endpoint configuration (e.g. GovSlack, GitHub Enterprise, GCC-High Teams)
- a520797: Add `chat.getUser()` method and `UserInfo` type for cross-platform user lookups. Implement `getUser` on Slack, Discord, Google Chat, GitHub, Linear, and Telegram adapters.
- 70281dc: add initialOption and option_groups support for ExternalSelect
- 2531e9c: Add dynamic `botToken` resolver and custom `webhookVerifier` to Slack adapter config. `botToken` now accepts `string | (() => string | Promise<string>)` so apps can rotate or lazily fetch tokens — the function is invoked per API call. `webhookVerifier: (request: Request) => string | Promise<string>` is used in place of `signingSecret` when set (and `signingSecret` is not provided), letting hosts verify incoming requests with their own logic and return the verified body text; the adapter responds 401 if the verifier throws.
- 7e90d9c: Add Socket Mode support for environments behind firewalls that can't expose public HTTP endpoints, and add `{ action: "clear" }` modal response to close the entire modal view stack
- a179b29: Implement external_select block kit for Slack

### Patch Changes

- 1e7c551: restore attachment fetchData after queue/debounce serialization
- 53c6b68: Fix DM messages failing with `invalid_thread_ts` by guarding Slack API calls with `threadTs || undefined`
- ded6f78: enrich link previews with title, description, and image from Slack unfurl attachments
- c26ee6c: Fix `@mention` rewrite regex so email addresses (e.g. `user@example.com`) and `<mailto:…>` links are no longer mangled into broken Slack user mentions. The lookbehind now excludes any word character before `@`, which also means mentions immediately following a word character (e.g. `prefix@user`) are no longer rewritten — a bare `@user` still converts as before.
- 0f8b2b1: Fix self-mention detection in multi-workspace installs by using the request-scoped bot user ID instead of the adapter-level default

## 4.16.1

### Patch Changes

- f0dfa4d: Fix nested list rendering in Markdown-to-platform converters

  All adapters (Slack, Discord, Teams, Google Chat) were flattening nested
  lists during `fromAst()` conversion, causing child items to be concatenated
  directly onto the parent item without any indentation or newline separation.

  The `nodeToX()` list handler now accepts a `depth` parameter and uses it to
  produce platform-appropriate indentation (`"  ".repeat(depth)`) for nested
  lists. Each list item's children are processed in order: paragraph content
  is prefixed with the bullet/number at the correct indent level, and nested
  list nodes are rendered recursively at `depth + 1`.
