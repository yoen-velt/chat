# @chat-adapter/messenger

## 4.30.0

### Patch Changes

- 9b8d8c4: expand npm `keywords` for adapter and state packages to improve discoverability (adds `chat-sdk`, `chatbot`, `ai-agent`, `ai-sdk`, `vercel`, plus platform-specific terms)
- Updated dependencies [5461ea9]
  - chat@4.30.0
  - @chat-adapter/shared@4.30.0

## 4.29.0

### Minor Changes

- 2ffed48: Adapter internals are now `protected` rather than `private`, so consumers can subclass an adapter to override or extend its behavior (e.g. handling additional Telegram update types by overriding `processUpdate`).

### Patch Changes

- e60bc8c: chore: set supported Node versions in engines
- 06fb8e5: Align package shapes with the new `konsistent` conventions. All changes are
  backwards-compatible — previous type names are kept as deprecated aliases.

  - `@chat-adapter/gchat`, `@chat-adapter/slack`: moved `*AdapterConfig` (and
    related sub-types) into a `./types` module; the public re-exports from
    `index.ts` are unchanged.
  - `@chat-adapter/slack`: `createSlackAdapter` now accepts `SlackAdapterConfig`
    directly instead of `Partial<SlackAdapterConfig>`. Every field on the config
    was already optional, so no call sites need to change.
  - `@chat-adapter/messenger`: `MessengerAdapterConfig` fields are now optional
    (the factory still falls back to `FACEBOOK_*` env vars), and `logger` /
    `userName` live on `MessengerAdapterConfig` directly. The factory signature
    is now `createMessengerAdapter(config?: MessengerAdapterConfig)`.
  - `@chat-adapter/web`: renamed `WebAdapterOptions` to `WebAdapterConfig`; the
    old name is exported as a deprecated alias.
  - `@chat-adapter/whatsapp`: every field on `WhatsAppAdapterConfig` is optional
    (the factory still falls back to `WHATSAPP_*` env vars). `createWhatsAppAdapter`
    is now typed `(config?: WhatsAppAdapterConfig) => WhatsAppAdapter`.
  - `@chat-adapter/state-memory`: added an empty `MemoryStateAdapterOptions`
    type so the package matches every other state adapter; `createMemoryState`
    now accepts an optional argument of that type.
  - `@chat-adapter/state-ioredis`, `@chat-adapter/state-redis`,
    `@chat-adapter/state-pg`: the URL- and client-based option shapes were split
    into named interfaces (`*StateAdapterUrlOptions` /
    `*StateAdapterClientOptions`) and unified under `*StateAdapterOptions`. The
    factories now take the union type directly. Old names — `RedisStateClientOptions`,
    `CreateRedisStateOptions`, `PostgresStateClientOptions`,
    `CreatePostgresStateOptions`, `IoRedisStateClientOptions` — are kept as
    deprecated aliases.
